## Dervico slot task

## Problems
I did't understand one part:

when symbol stop's on a center line does partly visible top and bottom lines counts as win linse
so I made two branches

Master: top and bottom counts as win lines when stoped on center

on-center-stop-line-ignore-bottom-an-top-win-lines : ignore top and bottom when stopped on center

### Responsive design
It's hard to combine work and test task so I could't optimize App look for diffrent screens

The app looks well only in full screen desktop

### Debug mode

You should always push set positions button to change where reels need to stop otherwise it will use old value
